# tquery
A python parser for telegram chats

# about
This code doesn't expose any public functions so if you want to do statistical analysis you have to call the functions inside the code and rerun the script. To use 
the code download the .json from your Telegram Chat and set the correct path in line ```54```. 

The variable ```blacklist``` can be used to ignore certain users like Bots from the queries.
